## Week 2 Assignment: Student Store

Submitted by: **Henry**

### Application Features

#### CORE FEATURES

- [X] The API should contain an endpoint that serves an array of all products in the store
- [X] A Store model should handle all data management logic for the API and be the interface for read/write operations to the JSON file.
- [X] The frontend should include a landing page that displays the products available for purchase.
- [X] Each product should have an individual page that shows the details of the product.

#### STRETCH FEATURES

- [ ] Deploy your website with Heroku & Surge. 
- [ ] An endpoint should exist for creating orders and saving them to a JSON file. Each order should contain the email of the person placing the order, the items associated with the order, and the quantity of each item purchased.
- [ ] There should be a `Sidebar` component that appears on every page and has two states - `open` and `closed`. When the sidebar is opened, it should display a shopping cart of all the products the user currently has in their cart. It should also calculate and display the total amount in dollars for the checked-out items. When it's closed, the sidebar should be much thinner and not display its internal content.
- [ ] A checkout form should be available that allows the user to enter their email and send their order to the API.
- [ ] Create an endpoint for fetching all orders in the database, and an endpoint for serving an individual order based on its id.
- [X] Create an endpoint that serves only a single product based on the product's id
- [ ] Build a page in the UI that displays the list of all past orders and lets the user click on any individual order to take them to a more detailed page of the transaction.
- [ ] Allow users to use an input to filter orders by the email of the person who placed the order.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs prepared me for completing the assignment. The features in the weekly assignment I didn't feel prepared to complete were the stretch features such as the sidebar with the shopping cart display of all products the user has. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have tried working on more stretch features and definitely worked on more of the CSS. I think I also would have experimented more with Figma. Some of my peers started with Figma and they were able to use their designs from Figma to inform their CSS. In the future I would like to practice using Figma to help with the design.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The project demo went as expected since there's not much to display. I noticed that one of my peers used a float attribute in the CSS. She showed me how to use it and I was amazed at what a big difference the float made. I definitely want to try using float next time.
